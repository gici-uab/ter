- Corrected a bug in the progression order 0 for gaggles
with size different from 16.
- Some minor bugs corrected.
- Speed up the load/save of some image formats.
---- version 2.01 beta (March 2008) ----
- Corrected an bug in the parameters parser.
- Added in the headers the minimum and the maximum value of the input
image. This way the performance when ranging the parameters in the
decoder is improved.
- Added a mode to encode several targets at the same time. Thus
speed is significantly improved in tests (only available for .ter files,
and using the target byte or bpppb, not for compression factor).
For more information see (-tb -targetBytes). Note that -bpp paramater has been
replaceb by --bpppb. See TERcode -h for more details.
- Added a parameter to range and center the recovered pixels according
to the original parameters (see -rp --rangePixelsRecovered).
---- version 2.0 beta (November 2007) ----
- Added 'TERdisplay' a command to extract regions from the
encoded image using only the parts of the streams required. (testing)
- Added a module that allows three dimensional wavelet transform.(testing)
- Added resolution, position, component and quality scalability.
- Modified the parameter to select the name of the output encoded file.
(-o --outputFile) For more information type ./TERcode -h.
---- version 1.1 (January 2007) ----
- Added options to approximate the transformed coefficients before
applying the bit plane encoder step. Related parameter: -ca 
(--coefficientsApproximation). For more information type ./TERcode -h.
- Added options to pre-process the input image. Related parameters
are : -st (--shiftType), -sc (--shiftChannels) and -sv (--shiftValues).
For more information type ./TERcode -h.
- Minor errors have been corrected. Improved the speed in the 
interleaving step.
- Added a new option to the parameter -gv (--gammaValue) that
recover to several points of the interval. For instance, to 0.25 of the 
interval. For more information type ./TERdecode -h.
---- version 1.04 (September 2006) ----
- Added parameter -cm (--completionMode) to choose the way DC are 
completed when the encoded file ends unexpectedly. For more information 
type ./TERdecode -h.
- Corrected some minors errors fot the --recoveryMode 1. DC components were 
recovered always to the lowest value of the interval.
- Added parameter -co (--compressionOrder) to set the way of creating
each encoded segment. The user may choose between encode from the highest
to the lowest bitplane or from the first to the last block in the segment.
---- version 1.03 (July 2006) ----
- Some minor errors have been corrected in the encoder
- Added parameter -ap (--adjustHeaderParameters) to adjust values 
of the header once encoding process has finished. For more information 
type ./TERcode -h.
- Added parameter to fix truncation points -tp (--truncationPoints) 
in the encoded file. For more information type ./TERcode -h.
- When the user employs the parameter -bl (--segByteLimit) as a decoder
parameter, the decoder stops at the given segByteLimit when available.
- Added the parameter -rm (--recoveryMode) to the decoder. This parameter
allows the user to indicate how the parameters must be recovered during
the bit plane decoder (to the middle value or to the lowest value of the 
interval).
- Corrected some minor errors while parsing parameters for decoding process.
- Eliminated parameters -h2, -h3 and -h4 since they were no longer needed.
- Eliminated the parameter -rc (--recommendation) since it was no longer
needed.
- Added support to create encoded files by giving compression factor 
(-cr or --compressionFactor) instead segByteLimit or bitsPerPixel.
- Corrected a problem in CreateFile for very low bit rates.
---- version 1.02 (June 2006) ----
- Added support for loading pgm images of 2 bytes.
- Added support for saving pgm images of 2 bytes.
- Improved the computation and memory performance for low bit rates.
- Modified input parameter --stageStop (-ss). Now the input values are
the same as the ones in the recomendation.
- Corrected how the numbers of rows that must be added after decoding
the segment. In previous versions it could provide some problems.
---- Version 1.01 (May 2006) ----
- Corrected the mistake produced when segByteLimit was used togheter
with useFill equal to 0  
- Some errors in the help text have been corrected.
- The users receives a warning when tries to saved a pgm with more
than one byte.
---- Version 1.0 (May 2006) ----
